# Transcripto â€“ YouTube Transcript SaaS

Transcripto is a modern, AI-powered SaaS platform that allows users to extract, view, and interact with YouTube video transcripts. Built primarily to showcase frontend expertise using **React + Vite + Tailwind**, the project also includes a lightweight **FastAPI** backend integrated with AI features to support transcript-based Q&A, authentication, history, and subscriptions.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** While the backend is included, the focus of this project is on demonstrating advanced frontend architecture, UI/UX design, and integration with real APIs.
